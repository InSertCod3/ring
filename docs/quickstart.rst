Installation
------------

PyPI is the recommended way.

.. sourcecode:: shell

    $ pip install ring

To browse versions and tarballs, visit:

Though *Ring* includes built-in supports for many backends, they are not a part
of ring installaion. :func:`ring.dict` doesn't require any dependency. Let's
start with it. For more backends, see :ref:`backends`.
